good in spite of religion 

It seems like that'd be the only conclusion to draw if you want to argue that a group can't be defined by its members and that morality is randomly predetermined
But also that that morality has no bearing on which group you're attracted to

You even agreed with me when I sought to clarify with things like asking if you think morality is predetermined at random.  If you take those two things as rote rules to the universe and then look at any other group, things get weird
